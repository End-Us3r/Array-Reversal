# Array-Reversal

This Java code defines a class called "ArrayReversal" that contains two methods: "reverseVals" and "main". The "reverseVals" method takes an integer array as input and reverses its order using a temporary variable to perform a swap. The "main" method prompts the user to enter eight integer values, populates an array with these values, and then calls the "reverseVals" method to reverse the order of the values in the array. The final output displays the updated array values in reverse order. The code imports the "java.util.Scanner" class to allow user input from the console.
